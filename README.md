# This Readme file is linked to a (very) personal project :art: :woman_artist: :

I decided to do a project that I have wanted to do for a long time. It is a one page site where I will try to practice my knowledge of HTML and CSS and complete it as I progress. 

:blond_haired_person:  It's a project I want to do, too, to think about something else in a not very fun moment.

## The details of this fun project :writing_hand:

### What is it about ? :speech_balloon:

I wanted to dedicate this site to pioneering women in the world of technology and essentially, the web ! 

### What this project will looks like by the end ? :mag_right: 

It will involve creating a small clickable photo gallery with the avatars of several pioneering women and thus, discovering their stories and main inventions. I also want to code a little quiz game, probably in JS, but still have to get the lesson and advices to make it, maybe with a video tutorial. 

## Objective of the project :dart: : 

- To have fun, 
- To please myself by creating a design that I like,
- To learn and prctice some small notions, 
- And to talk about a subject that I find fascinating and not popular enough : women in history of tech.

## Tools i plan to use :hammer_and_wrench: : 
- Visual Code Studio, 
- Canva (I decided to do the wireframe here, a bit by chance rather than Figma, because i was inspired by the gallery of icons and illustrations on that day of june 2024), 
- Web (research on pioneering women), 
- Old tests of static sites in HTML and CSS i made,
- W3School 
- And Chat GPT for some questions,
- And maybe some tuto or a course about JS for one small part i want to make.

## Language of the project :en: :

I plan to make this project in english to practice a little.
